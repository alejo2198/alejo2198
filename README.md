## My Experience
I am a junior web developer. I have done freelance work with my friends.
Feel free to check out our [website](https://flf-freelance.netlify.app/).

I have experience working with a team as well as individually as a freelancer.
I developed and co-designed this [website](https://quickresponseplumbing.ca/) for a local plumbing business.
